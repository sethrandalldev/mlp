# Multilayer Perceptron Project
#
# The goal of this project is to implement the feed-forward algorithm for applying a multilayer perceptron to a data point and the backpropagation algorithm for training a multilayer perceptron. To simplify this problem, we will assume that this MLP does binary classification.
